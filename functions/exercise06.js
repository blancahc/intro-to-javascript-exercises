//What does the following code log to the console?

function scream(words) {
  return words + '!!!!';
}

scream('Yipeee');

// My Answer: Yipeee!!!!

//The Answer: This program also doesn't log anything. The function returns a value, Yipeee!!!!, but it doesn't do anything with it. In particular, 
//it doesn't write it to the console.
