// What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?
// My Answer: It is when you catch an error so that the rest of the program doesn't crash. 
// The Answer: Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and predictable manner. It uses the try/catch statement to catch exceptions that the code in the try block raises, and lets the programmer deal with the problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic failure or nasty bug.
