//Which of the following values are valid keys for an object?

//My Answer
//1 - valid
//'1' - valid
//undefined - invalid
//'hello world' - vale
//true - invalid 
//'true' - valid

//The Answer: 
// All the listed values are valid keys. Note, though, that JavaScript coerces the non-string key 
// values to strings. Given the listed values, 1 and '1' represent the same key, as do true and 
// 'true'. This equivalency will bite you at some point; it's inevitable, so be ready.
