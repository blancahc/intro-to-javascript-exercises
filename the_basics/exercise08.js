// 8. Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index that is greater than or equal to the 
// length of the array? For example:

// var foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
// foo.length;  // returns 3
// foo[3];      // will this result in an error? 

//My answer: It will say undefined.
//The Answer: No, there won't be an error. When you use an index value that has no corresponding element, 
//JavaScript returns undefined.
